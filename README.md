# 🤖 Arduino-Based Line Following Robot

## 📖 Overview

The **Arduino-Based Line Following Robot** is an embedded systems project designed to autonomously follow a predefined path using infrared (IR) sensors. The robot continuously detects the line, processes sensor inputs through an Arduino Uno, and controls DC motors using an L298N motor driver. Python utilities were also developed for automatic hardware testing, sensor validation, line-following logic simulation, and manual robot control.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. The IR sensors continuously detect the surface beneath the robot.
2. Sensor readings are sent to the Arduino Uno.
3. The Arduino processes the sensor inputs.
4. Based on the detected line position, the Arduino controls the motors through the L298N motor driver.
5. The robot automatically adjusts its direction to remain on the line.
6. Python utilities are used for hardware testing, logic validation, and manual robot control.
